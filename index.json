Conversely, pairwise interactions are often not enough to characterize social contagion processes such as opinion formation or the adoption of novelties, where complex mechanisms of influence and reinforcement are at work. Here we introduce a higher-order model of social contagion in which a social system is represented by a simplicial complex and contagion can occur through interactions in groups of different sizes. Numerical simulations of the model on both empirical and synthetic simplicial complexes highlight the emergence of novel phenomena such as a discontinuous transition induced by higher-order interactions. We show analytically that the transition is discontinuous and that a bistable region appears where healthy and endemic states co-exist. Our results help explain why critical masses are required to initiate social changes and contribute to the understanding of higher-order interactions in complex systems.","tags":[],"title":"Simplicial Models of social Contagion","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558812917,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558812917,"objectID":"957fcef6e8d2b5ffa564638118fa1c8c","permalink":"https://lordgrilo.github.io/project/tda/","publishdate":"2019-05-25T15:35:17-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/tda/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Topological Data Analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558812652,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558812652,"objectID":"d120088af90c5f550b2a19356ad57b38","permalink":"https://lordgrilo.github.io/project/net-dynamics/","publishdate":"2019-05-25T15:30:52-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/net-dynamics/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Network and Simplicial Dynamics","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558811583,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558811583,"objectID":"786bc0dd3dc12f3699f1df0bff8382d8","permalink":"https://lordgrilo.github.io/project/topo-neuro/","publishdate":"2019-05-25T15:13:03-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/topo-neuro/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Topological Neuroscience","type":"project"},{"authors":["Caleb Geniesse","Olaf Sporns","Giovanni Petri","Manish Saggar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558810652,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558810652,"objectID":"b9993551ee65694d023ea8488835858d","permalink":"https://lordgrilo.github.io/publication/dynseur/","publishdate":"2019-05-25T14:57:32-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/dynseur/","section":"publication","summary":"In this article, we present an open source neuroinformatics platform for exploring, analyzing, and validating distilled graphical representations of high-dimensional neuroimaging data extracted using topological data analysis (TDA). TDA techniques like Mapper have been recently applied to examine the brain’s dynamical organization during ongoing cognition without averaging data in space, in time, or across participants at the outset. Such TDA-based approaches mark an important deviation from standard neuroimaging analyses by distilling complex high-dimensional neuroimaging data into simple—yet neurophysiologically valid and behaviorally relevant—representations that can be interactively explored at the single-participant level. To facilitate wider use of such techniques within neuroimaging and general neuroscience communities, our work provides several tools for visualizing, interacting with, and grounding TDA-generated graphical representations in neurophysiology. Through Python-based Jupyter notebooks and open datasets, we provide a platform to assess and visualize different intermittent stages of Mapper and examine the influence of Mapper parameters on the generated representations. We hope this platform could enable researchers and clinicians alike to explore topological representations of neuroimaging data and generate biological insights underlying complex mental disorders.","tags":[],"title":"Generating dynamical neuroimaging spatiotemporal representations (DyNeuSR) using topological data analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alice Patania","Pierluigi Selvaggi","Mattia Veronese","Ottavia Di Pasquale","Paul Expert","Giovanni Petri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1558736162,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558736162,"objectID":"de29c0508c62d105aed4c0126a0ac3fe","permalink":"https://lordgrilo.github.io/publication/gene-mapper/","publishdate":"2019-05-24T17:16:02-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gene-mapper/","section":"publication","summary":"Understanding how gene expression translates to and affects human behaviour is one of the ultimate goals of neuroscience.

We analysed EEG signals recorded in 20 highs and 19 lows in basal conditions (head forward) and during RH, using spectral analysis, which captures changes localized to specific recording sites, and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), which instead describes large-scale differences in processing and representing sensorimotor information. Spectral analysis revealed significant differences related to the head position for alpha1, beta2, beta3, gamma bands, but not to hypnotizability. TDA instead revealed global hypnotizability-related differences in the strengths of the correlations among recording sites during RH. Significant changes were observed in lows on the left parieto-occipital side and in highs in right fronto-parietal region. Significant differences between the two groups were found in the occipital region, where changes were larger in lows than in highs.

As a result, predicting when, where, and how far diseases will spread requires a complex systems approach to modeling. Recent studies have demonstrated that predicting different components of outbreaks--e.g., the expected number of cases, pace and tempo of cases needing treatment, importation probability etc.--is feasible. Therefore, advancing both the science and practice of disease forecasting now requires testing for the presence of fundamental limits to outbreak prediction. To investigate the question of outbreak prediction, we study the information theoretic limits to forecasting across a broad set of infectious diseases using permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability. Studying the predictability of a diverse collection of historical outbreaks--including, gonorrhea, influenza, Zika, measles, polio, whooping cough, and mumps--we identify a fundamental entropy barrier for time series forecasting. However, we find that for most diseases this barrier to prediction is often well beyond the time scale of single outbreaks, implying prediction is likely to succeed. We also find that the forecast horizon varies by disease and demonstrate that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are the most likely mechanisms for the observed differences in predictability across contagions. Our results highlight the importance of moving beyond time series forecasting, by embracing dynamic modeling approaches to prediction and suggest challenges for performing model selection across long disease time series. We further anticipate that our findings will contribute to the rapidly growing field of epidemiological forecasting and may relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.","tags":["predictability"],"title":"On the predictability of infectious disease outbreaks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guilherme Ferraz de Arruda","Giovanni Petri","Francisco A.

Additionally, we show that the critical value of infectivity tends to be smaller than the one predicted by quenched mean-field approaches in the homogeneous case and that it can be linked to the variance of the recovery rates. We then illustrate the role of dynamical--structural correlations, which allow for a complete change in the critical behavior.

Here, we propose a framework to model such an evolution: the Simplicial Activity Driven (SAD) model, in which the building block is a simplex of nodes representing a multi-agent interaction. We show analytically and numerically that the use of simplicial structures leads to crucial differences in the outcome of paradigmatic processes modelling disease propagation or social contagion, with respect to the activity-driven (AD) model, a paradigmatic temporal network model involving only binary interactions. In particular, fluctuations in the number of nodes involved in the interactions can affect the outcome of models of simple contagion processes, contrarily to what happens in the AD model. Moreover, social contagion models such as cascading processes present a much richer phenomenology and can become extremely slow when occurring on evolving simplicial complexes.","tags":[],"title":"Simplicial Activity Driven Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

We show that the degree of functional equivalence varies in the population and is associated with different magnitudes in the restructuring of the functional connectivity between imagery and real tasks. In particular, changes observed during imagery with respect to basal conditions account for the cognitive effort experienced during imagery, and subjects characterized by stronger functional equivalence exhibit smaller topological deviations in the imagination tasks performed after real tasks, thus showing learning effects. Altogether, our findings point to different sensori-cognitive information processing in the subjects showing different functional equivalence.

Here, we approach this problem by leveraging topological tools to create charts of features spaces. These charts highlight feature sub-groups that encode similar information (and their respective similarities) allowing for a principled and interpretable choice of features for classification and analysis. Using multiple electromyographic (EMG) datasets as a case study, we use this feature chart to identify functional groups among 58 state-of-the-art EMG features, and to show that they generalize across three different forearm EMG datasets obtained from able-bodied subjects during hand and finger contractions. We find that these groups describe meaningful non-redundant information, succinctly recapitulating information about different regions of feature space.

Here, we show that these two characteristics are in tension, reflecting a fundamental tradeoff between interactive parallelism that supports learning and generalization, and independent parallelism that supports processing efficiency through concurrent multitasking. We formally show that, while the maximum number of tasks that can be performed simultaneously grows linearly with network size, under realistic scenarios (e.g. in an unpredictable environment), the expected number that can be performed concurrently grows radically sublinearly with network size. Hence, even modest reliance on shared representation strictly constrains the number of tasks that can be performed simultaneously, implying profound consequences for the development of artificial intelligence that optimally manages the tradeoff between learning and processing, and for un- derstanding the human brain’s remarkably puzzling mix of sequential and parallel capabilities.","tags":null,"title":"Universal limits to parallel processing capability of network architectures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

This has proven a significant paradigm shift from the study of individual brain regions in isolation. Graph-based models of the brain consist of vertices, which represent distinct brain areas, and edges which encode the presence (or absence) of a structural or functional relationship between each pair of vertices. By definition, any graph metric will be defined upon this dyadic representation of the brain activity. It is however unclear to what extent these dyadic relationships can capture the brain's complex functional architecture and the encoding of information in distributed networks. Moreover, because network representations of global brain activity are derived from measures that have a continuous response (i.e., interregional BOLD signals), it is methodologically complex to characterize the architecture of functional networks using traditional graph-based approaches. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between standard network metrics computed from dyadic interactions in a functional network, and a metric defined on the persistence homological scaffold of the network, which is a summary of the persistent homology structure of resting-state fMRI data. The persistence homological scaffold is a summary network that differs in important ways from the standard network representations of functional neuroimaging data: (i) it is constructed using the information from all edge weights comprised in the original network without applying an ad hoc threshold and (ii) as a summary of persistent homology, it considers the contributions of simplicial structures to the network organization rather than dyadic edge-vertices interactions. We investigated the information domain captured by the persistence homological scaffold by computing the strength of each node in the scaffold and comparing it to local graph metrics traditionally employed in neuroimaging studies. We conclude that the persistence scaffold enables the identification of network elements that may support the functional integration of information across distributed brain networks.","tags":null,"title":"Insights into Brain Architectures from the Homological Scaffolds of Functional Connectivity Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I.

The dataset reports the international country codes of every call/SMS made and received by mobile phone users in Milan, Italy, between November and December 2013, with a spatial resolution of about 200 meters. We first show that the observed spatial distribution of international codes well matches the distribution of international communities reported by official statistics, confirming the value of mobile phone data for demographic research. Next, we define an entropy function to measure the heterogeneity of the international phone activity in space and time. By comparing the entropy function to empirical data, we show that it can be used to identify the city’s hotspots, defined by the presence of points of interests. Eventually, we use the entropy function to characterize the spatial distribution of international communities in the city. Adopting a topological data analysis approach, we find that international mobile phone users exhibit some robust clustering patterns that correlate with basic socio-economic variables. Our results suggest that mobile phone records can be used in conjunction with topological data analysis tools to study the geography of migrant communities in a global city.","tags":null,"title":"Unveiling patterns of international communities in a global city using mobile phone data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

Rev. Neurosci. 10, 186–198. (doi:10.1038/nrn2618)). Traditionally, the structure of complex networks has been studied through their statistical properties and metrics concerned with node and link properties, e.g. degree-distribution, node centrality and modularity. Here, we study the characteristics of functional brain networks at the mesoscopic level from a novel perspective that highlights the role of inhomogeneities in the fabric of functional connections. This can be done by focusing on the features of a set of topological objects—homological cycles—associated with the weighted functional network. We leverage the detected topological information to define the homological scaffolds, a new set of objects designed to represent compactly the homological features of the correlation network and simultaneously make their homological properties amenable to networks theoretical methods. As a proof of principle, we apply these tools to compare resting-state functional brain activity in 15 healthy volunteers after intravenous infusion of placebo and psilocybin—the main psychoactive component of magic mushrooms. The results show that the homological structure of the brain's functional patterns undergoes a dramatic change post-psilocybin, characterized by the appearance of many transient structures of low stability and of a small number of persistent ones that are not observed in the case of placebo.","tags":null,"title":"Homological scaffolds of brain functional networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

The study of network properties, and their implications on dynamical processes, mostly focus on locally defined quantities of nodes and edges, such as node degrees, edge weights and –more recently– correlations between neighboring nodes. However, statistical methods quickly become cumbersome when dealing with many-body properties and do not capture the precise mesoscopic structure of complex networks. Here we introduce a novel method, based on persistent homology, to detect particular non-local structures, akin to weighted holes within the link-weight network fabric, which are invisible to existing methods. Their properties divide weighted networks in two broad classes: one is characterized by small hierarchically nested holes, while the second displays larger and longer living inhomogeneities. These classes cannot be reduced to known local or quasilocal network properties, because of the intrinsic non-locality of homological properties, and thus yield a new classification built on high order coordination patterns. Our results show that topology can provide novel insights relevant for many-body interactions in social and spatial networks. Moreover, this new method creates the first bridge between network theory and algebraic topology, which will allow to import the toolset of algebraic methods to complex systems.","tags":null,"title":"Topological strata of weighted complex networks","type":"publication"}]
