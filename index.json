Frequently, single-groups are modeled as critical-mass dynamics, which is a widespread concept used not only by academics but also by politicians and the media. However, less explored questions are how a collection of groups will behave and how the intersection between these groups might change the global dynamics. Here, we formulate this process in terms of binary state dynamics on hypergraphs. We showed that our model has a very rich and unexpected behavior that goes beyond discontinuous transitions. In particular, we might have multistability and intermittency as a consequence of bimodal state distributions. By using artificial random models, we demonstrated that this phenomenology could be associated with community structures. Specifically, we might have multistability or intermittency by controlling the number of bridges between two communities with different densities. The introduction of bridges destroys multistability but creates an intermittent behavior. Furthermore, we provide an analytical formulation showing that the observed pattern for the order parameter and susceptibility are compatible with hybrid phase transitions. Our findings open new paths for research, ranging from physics, on the formal calculation of quantities of interest, to social sciences, where new experiments can be designed.","tags":["hypergraph contagion","dynamics","multistability","intermittency"],"title":"Multistability, intermittency and hybrid transitions in social contagion models on hypergraphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

In turn, this provides a generalized formulation of the Kuramoto higher-order parameter as a potential function to write the dynamics as a gradient flow. We study the properties of the dynamics of the simplicial Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model with oscillators on edges using a selection of simplicial complexes of increasingly complex structure, to highlight the complexity of dynamical behaviors emerging from even simple simplicial complexes. In particular, using the Hodge decomposition of the solution, we understand how the nonlinear frustration couples the dynamics in orthogonal subspaces.

Despite a plethora of methods having been proposed for the analysis of multivariate time series, most of them do not investigate whether signals result from independent, pairwise, or group interactions. Here, we propose a novel framework to characterize the temporal evolution of higher-order dependencies within multivariate time series. Using network analysis and topology, we show that, unlike traditional tools, our framework robustly differentiates various spatiotemporal regimes of coupled chaotic maps, including chaotic dynamical phases and various types of synchronization.\nBy analysing fMRI signals, we find that, during rest, the human brain mainly oscillates between chaotic and few partially intermittent states, with higher-order structures reflecting sensorimotor areas. Similarly, in financial and epidemic time series, instead, higher-order information efficiently discriminates between radically different coordination and spreading regimes. Overall, our approach sheds new light on the higher-order organization of multivariate time series, allowing for a better characterization of dynamical group dependencies inherent to real-world systems.","tags":["Multivariate timeseries","simplicial dynamics","tda"],"title":"Unveiling the higher-order organization of multivariate time series","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.R.

The degree to which social and asocial learning share the same mechanisms is still a matter of debate, and, so far, studies investigating the neuronal basis of these two types of learning are scarce and have been restricted to primates, including humans, and rodents. Here we have used a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm in which a social (fish image) or an asocial (circle image) conditioned stimulus (CS) have been paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US=food), and we have used the expression of the immediate early gene c-fos to map the neural circuits associated with social and asocial learning. Our results show that the learning performance is similar with social (fish image) and asocial (circle image) CSs. However, the brain regions involved in each learning type are distinct. Social learning is associated with an increased expression of c-fos in olfactory bulbs, ventral zone of ventral telencephalic area, ventral habenula and ventromedial thalamus, whereas asocial learning is associated with a decreased expression of c-fos in dorsal habenula and anterior tubercular nucleus. Using egonetworks, we further show that each learning type has an associated pattern of functional connectivity across brain regions. Moreover, a community analysis of the network data reveals four segregated functional submodules, which seem to be associated with different cognitive functions involved in the learning tasks: a generalized attention module, a visual response module, a social stimulus integration module and a learning module. Together, these results suggest that, although there are localized differences in brain activity between social and asocial learning, the two learning types share a common learning module and social learning also recruits a specific social stimulus integration module. Therefore, our results support the occurrence of a common general-purpose learning module, that is differentially modulated by localized activation in social and asocial learning.","tags":["networks","neuroscience","sociality","social behaviour","learning"],"title":"Social and asocial learning in zebrafish are encoded by a shared brain network that is differentially modulated by local activation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I.

Furthermore, although an influence of opened and closed eye condition onto hypnotizability has been reported, a systematic investigation is still missing. Here, we analyzed EEG signals from 34 healthy subjects with low (LS), medium (MS), and (HS) hypnotic susceptibility using power spectral measures (i.e., TPSD, PSD) and Lempel-Ziv-Complexity (i.e., LZC, fLZC). Indeed, LZC was found to be more suitable than other complexity measures for EEG analysis, while it has been never used in the study of hypnosis. Accordingly, for each measure, we investigated within-group differences between rest and neutral hypnosis, and between opened-eye/closed-eye conditions under both rest and neutral hypnosis. Then, we evaluated between-group differences for each experimental condition. We observed that, while power estimates did not reveal notable differences between groups, LZC and fLZC were able to distinguish between HS, MS, and LS. In particular, we found a left frontal difference between HS and LS during closed-eye rest. Moreover, we observed a symmetric pattern distinguishing HS and LS during closed-eye hypnosis. Our results suggest that LZC is better capable of discriminating subjects with different hypnotic susceptibility, as compared to standard power analysis.","tags":["brain","hypnosis","eeg"],"title":"Linear and Nonlinear Quantitative EEG Analysis during Neutral Hypnosis following an Opened/Closed Eye Paradigm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.G.

In this paper, we develop a novel mathematical framework based on approximate master equations to study contagions on random hypergraphs with a heterogeneous structure, both in terms of group size (hyperedge cardinality) and of membership of nodes to groups (hyperdegree). The characterization of the inner dynamics of groups provides an accurate description of the contagion process, without losing the analytical tractability. Using a contagion model where multi-body interactions are mapped onto a nonlinear infection rate, our two main results show how large groups are influential, in the sense that they drive both the early spread of a contagion and its endemic state (i.e., its stationary state). First, we provide a detailed characterization of the phase transition, which can be continuous or discontinuous with a bistable regime, and derive analytical expressions for the critical and tricritical points. We find that large values of the third moment of the membership distribution suppress the emergence of a discontinuous phase transition. Furthermore, the combination of heterogeneous group sizes and nonlinear contagion facilitates the onset of a mesoscopic localization phase, where contagion is sustained only by the largest groups, thereby inhibiting bistability as well. Second, we formulate the problem of optimal seeding for hypergraph contagion, and we compare two strategies: tuning the allocation of seeds according to either individual node or group properties. We find that, when the contagion is sufficiently nonlinear, groups are more effective seeds of contagion than individual nodes.","tags":["dynamics","hypergraphs","contagion"],"title":"Influential groups for seeding and sustaining nonlinear contagion in heterogeneous hypergraphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

The ability to perform multiple tasks simultaneously is also a signature characteristic of large-scale parallel architectures, that is evident in the human brain, and has been exploited effectively more traditional, massively parallel computational architectures. Here, we show that these two characteristics are in tension, reflecting a fundamental tradeoff between interactive parallelism that supports learning and generalization, and independent parallelism that supports processing efficiency through concurrent multitasking. We formally show that, while the maximum number of tasks that can be performed simultaneously grows linearly with network size, under realistic scenarios (e.g. in an unpredictable environment), the expected number that can be performed concurrently grows radically sublinearly with network size. Hence, even modest reliance on shared representation strictly constrains the number of tasks that can be performed simultaneously, implying profound consequences for the development of artificial intelligence that optimally manages the tradeoff between learning and processing, and for un- derstanding the human brain’s remarkably puzzling mix of sequential and parallel capabilities.","tags":[],"title":"Topological limits to the parallel processing capability of network architectures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

To facilitate wider use of such techniques within neuroimaging and general neuroscience communities, our work provides several tools for visualizing, interacting with, and grounding TDA-generated graphical representations in neurophysiology. Through Python-based Jupyter notebooks and open datasets, we provide a platform to assess and visualize different intermittent stages of Mapper and examine the influence of Mapper parameters on the generated representations.

We analysed EEG signals recorded in 20 highs and 19 lows in basal conditions (head forward) and during RH, using spectral analysis, which captures changes localized to specific recording sites, and Topological Data Analysis (TDA), which instead describes large-scale differences in processing and representing sensorimotor information. Spectral analysis revealed significant differences related to the head position for alpha1, beta2, beta3, gamma bands, but not to hypnotizability. TDA instead revealed global hypnotizability-related differences in the strengths of the correlations among recording sites during RH. Significant changes were observed in lows on the left parieto-occipital side and in highs in right fronto-parietal region. Significant differences between the two groups were found in the occipital region, where changes were larger in lows than in highs.

As a result, predicting when, where, and how far diseases will spread requires a complex systems approach to modeling. Recent studies have demonstrated that predicting different components of outbreaks--e.g., the expected number of cases, pace and tempo of cases needing treatment, importation probability etc.--is feasible. Therefore, advancing both the science and practice of disease forecasting now requires testing for the presence of fundamental limits to outbreak prediction. To investigate the question of outbreak prediction, we study the information theoretic limits to forecasting across a broad set of infectious diseases using permutation entropy as a model independent measure of predictability. Studying the predictability of a diverse collection of historical outbreaks--including, gonorrhea, influenza, Zika, measles, polio, whooping cough, and mumps--we identify a fundamental entropy barrier for time series forecasting. However, we find that for most diseases this barrier to prediction is often well beyond the time scale of single outbreaks, implying prediction is likely to succeed. We also find that the forecast horizon varies by disease and demonstrate that both shifting model structures and social network heterogeneity are the most likely mechanisms for the observed differences in predictability across contagions. Our results highlight the importance of moving beyond time series forecasting, by embracing dynamic modeling approaches to prediction and suggest challenges for performing model selection across long disease time series. We further anticipate that our findings will contribute to the rapidly growing field of epidemiological forecasting and may relate more broadly to the predictability of complex adaptive systems.","tags":["predictability"],"title":"On the predictability of infectious disease outbreaks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guilherme Ferraz de Arruda","Giovanni Petri","Francisco A.

Additionally, we show that the critical value of infectivity tends to be smaller than the one predicted by quenched mean-field approaches in the homogeneous case and that it can be linked to the variance of the recovery rates.

Moreover, these interactions often change over time. Here, we propose a framework to model such an evolution: the Simplicial Activity Driven (SAD) model, in which the building block is a simplex of nodes representing a multi-agent interaction. We show analytically and numerically that the use of simplicial structures leads to crucial differences in the outcome of paradigmatic processes modelling disease propagation or social contagion, with respect to the activity-driven (AD) model, a paradigmatic temporal network model involving only binary interactions. In particular, fluctuations in the number of nodes involved in the interactions can affect the outcome of models of simple contagion processes, contrarily to what happens in the AD model. Moreover, social contagion models such as cascading processes present a much richer phenomenology and can become extremely slow when occurring on evolving simplicial complexes.","tags":[],"title":"Simplicial Activity Driven Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.

Here, we approach this problem by leveraging topological tools to create charts of features spaces. These charts highlight feature sub-groups that encode similar information (and their respective similarities) allowing for a principled and interpretable choice of features for classification and analysis. Using multiple electromyographic (EMG) datasets as a case study, we use this feature chart to identify functional groups among 58 state-of-the-art EMG features, and to show that they generalize across three different forearm EMG datasets obtained from able-bodied subjects during hand and finger contractions.

This has proven a significant paradigm shift from the study of individual brain regions in isolation. Graph-based models of the brain consist of vertices, which represent distinct brain areas, and edges which encode the presence (or absence) of a structural or functional relationship between each pair of vertices. By definition, any graph metric will be defined upon this dyadic representation of the brain activity. It is however unclear to what extent these dyadic relationships can capture the brain's complex functional architecture and the encoding of information in distributed networks. Moreover, because network representations of global brain activity are derived from measures that have a continuous response (i.e., interregional BOLD signals), it is methodologically complex to characterize the architecture of functional networks using traditional graph-based approaches. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between standard network metrics computed from dyadic interactions in a functional network, and a metric defined on the persistence homological scaffold of the network, which is a summary of the persistent homology structure of resting-state fMRI data. The persistence homological scaffold is a summary network that differs in important ways from the standard network representations of functional neuroimaging data: (i) it is constructed using the information from all edge weights comprised in the original network without applying an ad hoc threshold and (ii) as a summary of persistent homology, it considers the contributions of simplicial structures to the network organization rather than dyadic edge-vertices interactions. We investigated the information domain captured by the persistence homological scaffold by computing the strength of each node in the scaffold and comparing it to local graph metrics traditionally employed in neuroimaging studies. We conclude that the persistence scaffold enables the identification of network elements that may support the functional integration of information across distributed brain networks.","tags":null,"title":"Insights into Brain Architectures from the Homological Scaffolds of Functional Connectivity Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I.

We will give a brief overview of Holes, a more detailed description of jHoles algorithm, its implementation and the problem of clique weight rank homology. We present a biological case study showing how the connectivity of epidermal cells changes in response to a tumor presence. The biological network has been derived from the proliferative, differentiated and stratum corneum compartments, and jHoles used for studying variation of the connectivity.","tags":null,"title":"jHoles: A Tool for Understanding Biological Complex Networks via Clique Weight Rank Persistent Homology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["G.

The study of network properties, and their implications on dynamical processes, mostly focus on locally defined quantities of nodes and edges, such as node degrees, edge weights and –more recently– correlations between neighboring nodes. However, statistical methods quickly become cumbersome when dealing with many-body properties and do not capture the precise mesoscopic structure of complex networks. Here we introduce a novel method, based on persistent homology, to detect particular non-local structures, akin to weighted holes within the link-weight network fabric, which are invisible to existing methods. Their properties divide weighted networks in two broad classes: one is characterized by small hierarchically nested holes, while the second displays larger and longer living inhomogeneities. These classes cannot be reduced to known local or quasilocal network properties, because of the intrinsic non-locality of homological properties, and thus yield a new classification built on high order coordination patterns. Our results show that topology can provide novel insights relevant for many-body interactions in social and spatial networks. Moreover, this new method creates the first bridge between network theory and algebraic topology, which will allow to import the toolset of algebraic methods to complex systems.","tags":null,"title":"Topological strata of weighted complex networks","type":"publication"}]
